# Julie Bergen's Portfolio Site

## The web design and development profile of Julie Bergen

I started this site when I got laid off and wanted to get a portfolio site up very quickly. I used a template which I purchased on Creative Market because I liked the design and it as relatively easy to plug in my information and work. Then when I had more time, I tore apart the back end and added some new technologies that I wanted to work with such as:

- Git (for version control)
- SASS (for smarter and more manageable css)
- More to come!

I am currently looking for new opportinuties. Please feel free to reach out if you have a position you think I may be a good fit for. http://www.juliebergen.com or julie@juliebergen.com

Thanks!
